function subbands = generate_subbands(signal, filts)

% SUBBANDS = GENERATE_SUBBANDS(SIGNAL, FILTS)
%
% filters SIGNAL with FILTS to generate subbands
%
% FILTS would typically be generated with one of the MAKE...FILTERS
% functions, e.g. MAKE_ERB_COS_FILTERS. FILTS contains coefficients for
% positive frequencies and is applied multiplicatively in the frequency
% domain
%
% FILTS are typically generated so that the sum of their squared response
% is flat across the frequency spectrum. They are thus applied once to
% generate subbands and then once more to collapse the subbands into a full
% bandwidth signal. This has the advantage of ensuring that the subbands
% remain appropriately bandlimited following any modifications that are
% made.
